# The-Re-Rendering
The Re-Rendering is an expansive kitchensink Modpack of all up and coming 1.10.2+ mods. 

"The Re-Rendering" is a quickly growing custom mod pack designed and released for Minecraft version 1.10.2, this is a community developed, supported and ran pack and we will be hosting servers with this pack quite regularly. As well as releasing officially supported server files and configuration file tweaks. The main design goal of the mod pack itself is to maintain a stable play experience for everyone who uses it on both single-player and multi-player, support a mid to long term length of game time and server time, as well as introduce and support a large and diverse group of mods including something for everyone to enjoy.


The pack will be updated regularly and we do welcome any and all user input regarding mod changes and general development of the pack. Feel free to leave us a comment or contact us directly.

 

Please do remember that the mod pack is currently still in development meaning that there will be bugs and other possible issues going forwards, please do let us know if you happen to come across anything. Thank you and enjoy!
